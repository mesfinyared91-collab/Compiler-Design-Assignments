# 📘 Intermediate Code Generation – Compiler Design

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains **Assignment-02** for the **Compiler Design** course.  
It focuses on **Intermediate Code Generation (ICG)**, a crucial phase of a compiler that bridges the **front end** and **back end** by converting high-level source code into a **machine-independent Intermediate Representation (IR)**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the role of **Intermediate Code Generation** in compiler design  
- Explain why **machine-independent IR** is essential for portability and optimization  
- Study different **types of Intermediate Representations**  
- Analyze real-world usage of IR through a **Java Bytecode case study**

---

## 🔍 Topics Covered
- 📌 Definition and purpose of Intermediate Code Generation  
- ⚙️ Role of ICG in compiler phases  

### 🧩 Types of Intermediate Code
#### 📊 Graphical IRs
- **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**
- **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**
- **Control Flow Graph (CFG)**

#### 🧮 Linear IRs
- **Postfix Notation**
- **Three Address Code (TAC)**

- 🚀 Applications and importance of Intermediate Representation  
- ☕ Case study: **Java Compiler and Bytecode**  
- ✅ Advantages and ❌ Disadvantages of Intermediate Code Generation  

---

## 🛠 Key Concepts Explained
- **Portability** 🌍  
  Same Intermediate Representation works across multiple machines.
- **Optimization** ⚙️  
  Code can be optimized before final machine code generation.
- **Retargetability** 🔄  
  Easier to generate code for different architectures.
- **Simplified Compiler Design** 🧠  
  One optimizer with multiple code generators.
